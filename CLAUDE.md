## 0. What This Fork Is, And What It Is Not

This is the **development fork** of the final-year project
"LLM-Powered Log Anomaly Detector with Attack Narrative & Adversarial Robustness".

| Repo | Role |
|---|---|
| `Project` @ tag `v1.0-submission` | The submitted academic artifact. Frozen. Report writing only. |
| `log-anomaly-detector-demo` | Standalone frozen demo folder. Ships `data/processed/` so it runs offline. Never develop here. |
| **`log-anomaly-detector-fork` (this repo)** | Real development. Free to break things v1 could not. |

The v1 code, the v1 evaluation results, and the v1 decision log are carried
into `docs/` as **inherited context**:

- `docs/CLAUDE.v1.md` — the original project doc. **Its Decision Log (section 10) is
  still authoritative history** and explains why most of the current code looks the
  way it does. Read it before changing detection code. Never delete it.
- `docs/results.v1/` — the v1 evaluation artifacts. These are the **baseline every
  future change is measured against.** Do not overwrite them; new results go in `results/`.
- `docs/DEMO.v1.md` — the v1 demo runbook, kept for the honest-answers Q&A section.

### The v1 numbers to beat

Everything below is measured on the synthetic corpus (751 lines, 5 users, 9 attack
instances across 3 scenarios). These are the reference points:

| Metric | v1 |
|---|---|
| Line-level precision / recall / F1 | 0.29 / 0.86 / 0.43 |
| Self-written rule baseline (clean) | 0.99 / 0.94 / 0.96 |
| Instance detection, clean | 100% (9/9), in 8 incidents |
| Instance detection, worst camouflage (`slow`) | 80% |
| Recall under `realistic-combo` — system vs baseline | 0.78 vs 0.07 |
| Alert volume | 94 incidents for 9 real attacks |
| Narrative cost | ~40-60s/incident on CPU (phi3) |

**Precision and alert volume are the weakest numbers and the main thing to fix.**
Robustness under camouflage is the strongest and must not regress to get there.

## 1. North Star

> A **local-first detection and explanation system that is continuously measured
> under adversarial conditions.**

The detection method is not the novelty — Isolation Forest over sentence embeddings
is standard, and saying otherwise in a write-up would be dishonest. Neither is
"we attached an LLM", which everyone is doing.

What is uncommon: **no open-source SIEM and very little of the published log-anomaly
literature reports how much worse it gets when the attacker actively tries to hide.**
This project does, on every change, as a gate.

Use this to decide what to build. If a proposed feature does not either
(a) improve detection/explanation, or (b) make the adversarial measurement more
credible, it is probably not worth doing.

---

## 1b. The Pre-Registered Kill Point

> **Registered 2026-08-17, before any Stage 1 code was written.**
> **This criterion may not be moved, softened, or reinterpreted after seeing results.**
> A kill point you can move is not a kill point.

The entire roadmap rests on one unverified assumption: **that v1's robustness gap
survives contact with rules the author did not write.** v1's headline collapse
(baseline recall 0.94 → 0.07 under `realistic-combo`, system 0.86 → 0.78) was measured
against *self-written, frequency-threshold* rules, which `slow` defeats almost by
definition. A mature third-party ruleset degrades by a different mechanism, and those
numbers do not transfer. Nobody knows the answer yet — that is the point.

So the assumption gets tested **first, cheaply, before anything is built on it.**

### The experiment

Third-party ruleset (**Sigma** primary, **Wazuh** if it cooperates) vs. this detector,
on a real OpenSSH corpus slice with attacks injected, all seven v1 camouflage strategies
applied, pooled over ≥5 seeds.

**Batch mode. One machine. No streaming, no two-machine split, no GPU dependency.**
Those are amplifiers — they make a good result more impressive and a mushy result
equally mushy. Nothing important may be sequenced behind them.

**Deadline: 4 weeks from the day Stage 1 starts.**

### The measurement

For each camouflage strategy, the drop in instance detection for each system. The
deciding number is the **differential between those drops**.

| Result | Decision |
|---|---|
| **≥25pt** differential on at least one strategy | **Continue.** The thesis survived third-party rules. Build the roadmap — streaming, bake-off, two-machine, GPU |
| **10-25pt** | **Partial.** Real but not dramatic. Cheap stages only; skip the amplifiers |
| **<10pt**, or the SIEM degrades *less* than this system does | **Stop.** Write it up as an honest negative result and move on |

Calibration: v1's differential was 87pt vs 8pt. 25pt is a far lower bar and still
clearly visible in a live demo.

### If it lands in the bottom row, publish that

*"A production SIEM ruleset is more robust to camouflage than an embedding detector"*
is a genuinely useful finding that nobody has written down, and it costs one month
instead of six. The temptation in that case will be to tune until the result looks
better — **that is the single biggest risk to this project's integrity**, larger than
any technical risk in it. v1 already faced this exact choice with the contamination
retune and got it right (see `docs/CLAUDE.v1.md`, 2026-08-16). Do it again.

**Do not script the demo narrative before this measurement exists.** Measure, then
write the story around what actually happened. Scripting first creates pressure to tune
until reality agrees.

---

## 2. Hard Constraints (kept from v1 — do not violate)

These survive the fork because they are physical or because they are genuine design
positions, not timeline excuses.

- **CPU is the supported floor, GPU is an accelerator.** The system must always run,
  end to end, on the CPU-only machine. "Runs on a laptop with no GPU" is a genuine
  differentiator — it is why a team with no SOC budget could deploy this. The moment
  a GPU becomes *required*, this becomes one more ML security tool with infrastructure
  demands. See §2c for hardware tiers.
- **Local-first.** No *required* cloud API. Optional cloud enrichment is acceptable
  only if the system degrades gracefully to fully-local operation.
- **No LLM fine-tuning. No models >8B params.** Training small task-specific models
  (sequence models over template IDs) is now allowed — see §2c. Fine-tuning the
  narrative LLM is not: it does not fix the detection problem, and it makes results
  much harder to reproduce in a write-up.
- **Single-box mode must always work.** The two-machine split (§2c) is a deployment
  *option*, never a requirement. A dead network link must downgrade the demo, not end it.
- **No auto-response / SOAR / blocking actions.** This is a deliberate product
  stance, not a scope cut: the system is decision support for an analyst. It may
  *recommend* actions. It must never take them.
- **The LLM never invents MITRE technique IDs.** Techniques come from data
  (lookup table, ATT&CK STIX, Sigma tags); the LLM only writes prose about matches
  it is handed. This is the design decision that stops the headline feature from
  being a hallucination generator. See the v1 `"nan"` incident in `docs/CLAUDE.v1.md`.
- **`uv` only.** Never bare `pip` or `python -m venv`.
  `uv` lives at `~/.local/bin/uv` and is not on `PATH` in non-interactive shells —
  `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` if you get `uv: command not found`.

## 2b. Constraints Dropped From v1 (these were timeline cuts)

Explicitly now **allowed**, and mostly required:

- ✅ Live/streaming ingestion (as file tailing + micro-batches, not Kafka)
- ✅ Multi-source correlation (auth + syslog + journald + web)
- ✅ Log formats beyond syslog/auth
- ✅ Real public datasets (LogHub), not just synthetic
- ✅ Third-party rulesets (Wazuh, Sigma) as baselines and as signal
- ✅ A real test suite, CI, packaging, a database, an API
- ✅ Dashboard/UX work

---

## 2c. Hardware Tiers

Two physical machines, split by **role, not by clustering.**

| | Machine A — "monitored host" | Machine B — "analyzer" |
|---|---|---|
| Hardware | Arch, 16GB RAM, **no GPU**, ~5GB free | Laptop, **RTX 4060 8GB VRAM** |
| Role | Emits logs (journald), runs the third-party SIEM (Wazuh/Sigma), plays the box under attack | Embeddings, sequence models, Ollama, dashboard, API |
| Also serves as | **The CPU-floor benchmark target** — this is what proves "runs on CPU" is measured, not claimed | Primary dev machine for detection work |

**Do not cluster them for compute.** Every model in this project fits on one 8GB GPU
(phi3-mini q4 ≈ 2.3GB, llama3:8b q4 ≈ 4.7GB, MiniLM ≈ 0.1GB, sequence models
negligible). Splitting a model that already fits, across a link three orders of
magnitude slower than on-card memory, makes inference *slower* while adding
`torch.distributed`/Ray complexity and a new class of demo-day failure.

Role-splitting is different, and it is worth it: it resolves the RAM squeeze (Wazuh on
A, Ollama on B), it *is* the collector/analyzer split from Stage 7 pulled forward, and
an examiner watching logs originate on one physical machine and alerts appear on
another is much harder to dismiss than two panes of one Streamlit app.

### The link

**Direct gigabit ethernet.** Machine A has *no ethernet port and no Thunderbolt/USB4
controller* (verified 2026-08-17: only `wlo1`; Alder Lake PCH with plain USB 3.2 xHCI,
no JHL chip). So: one USB-C/USB-A gigabit adapter for A, any Cat5e/Cat6 cable,
auto-MDIX handles the rest. A plain USB-C cable between two laptops does **not**
provide networking without Thunderbolt/USB4 on both ends.

Thunderbolt is not an option on this hardware, and it would buy nothing anyway —
**bandwidth is not the constraint.** 10k log lines/sec at ~200 bytes is ~2 MB/s, about
1.6% of a gigabit link. Optimise for reliability, not throughput.

Do not build the link on campus WiFi (`SJCEM`, measured -76 dBm): AP client isolation
very commonly blocks laptop-to-laptop traffic entirely, and it is undebuggable in a
demo room.

```bash
# Machine A, once the adapter is attached (find the name with: ip -br link)
nmcli con add type ethernet ifname enp0s20u1 con-name direct-link ip4 10.10.10.1/24
nmcli con mod direct-link ipv4.never-default yes   # or WiFi internet dies mid-demo
nmcli con up direct-link
# Machine B: same, 10.10.10.2/24. No gateway, no DNS, no DHCP on this link.
```

### Reliability is in the shipping code, not the cable

- Disk-backed buffer on the collector — a 3-second analyzer restart must not silently eat data
- Track a byte offset into the source log so reconnects neither duplicate nor skip
- HTTP POST with retry, never a raw socket: resume is trivial over one and painful over the other
- Link health + lag visible on the dashboard — "is it connected?" must be answerable by
  looking, not by inferring from an absence of alerts
- Test the exact adapter and cable you will present with, not an equivalent one

### What the 4060 unlocks, and what it does not

Unlocks: real-time narration (seconds, not 40-60s — this is what makes "explains it as
it happens" honest rather than an apology), llama3:8b instead of phi3, sequence-model
training, full-corpus LogHub runs, Wazuh's full stack alongside Ollama.

Does not: 70B models, full fine-tuning, transformer pretraining. None of which are needed.

Note mobile 4060s throttle under sustained load — expect long eval runs to report
slower per-item numbers than short ones, and plug in.

## 3. Progress Tracker

> **Agent: update this section at the end of every session.**

**Current stage:** Stage 0 — foundation
**Last session:** 2026-08-17 (fork created)
**Last commit:** _(initial)_

### Stage checklist

- [ ] **Stage 0 — Foundation.** Package restructure (`src/<pkg>/`, `tests/`, entry
      points), pytest replacing the v1 `__main__` smoke-test convention, GitHub Actions
      CI, and a persistence layer (SQLite or DuckDB) replacing CSV/JSON files.
      Unglamorous; everything else depends on it.
- [ ] **Stage 1 — Benchmark platform.** ⭐ *Comes before any detection change, and it
      carries the §1b kill point.* Automated eval suite that re-runs on every commit and
      reports deltas vs `docs/results.v1/`. Third-party baselines: **Sigma** (primary —
      pure Python, no daemon, no Arch packaging pain) and **Wazuh manager** (analysis
      engine only; the full indexer/dashboard stack will not fit in RAM). Real data:
      **LogHub OpenSSH + Linux** — see §3b for why not HDFS/BGL.
      This is where "rules written by people who never saw my data" replaces the
      self-written baseline — v1's single biggest credibility hole.
      **Build the harness to run in streaming mode with an injector-driven ground-truth
      feed, not just batch-over-a-file** — do that and Stage 2b falls out nearly free.
- [ ] **Stage 2 — Live ingestion.** Split fit-from-score and persist fitted models
      (fit on history, score on stream). File tailer + micro-batches; **journald as a
      real live source** (this machine is Arch — `journalctl -f` is genuine live
      traffic); replay mode for demos; FastAPI service so the dashboard is not the
      only interface. On CPU, LLM narration is **on-demand, not real-time** —
      40-60s/incident is a floor, not a tuning problem, and must be stated honestly
      rather than hidden. On the 4060 it becomes genuinely near-real-time; report both
      numbers, never quote the GPU one as if it were the CPU one.
- [ ] **Stage 2b — Live Bake-Off.** ⭐ *The demo. Depends on Stage 1 + Stage 2.*
      Benign traffic streams continuously into a tailed file; an **injection grid
      (attack type × camouflage level)** lets the audience fire attacks at both
      detectors on the same stream, side by side, with live precision/recall.
      Attack types: v1's brute force / impossible travel / enumeration, plus persistence
      (SSH key, cron), privilege-escalation chain, lateral movement. Levels: none /
      `slow` / `mimicry` / `ip_rotate` / `realistic-combo`.
      **Because the injector generates the attacks, ground truth is automatic** — both
      systems can be scored live. That is what makes it a running experiment rather
      than a slideshow, and it is the reason to build it this way.
      The three-act structure is: quiet baseline → obvious attack, *where the SIEM wins
      and we say so* → camouflaged attack, where the gap shows. **Act 2 is not "we fail
      to detect"** — v1 detects 100% of instances on clean data. It is "we both catch
      it; the SIEM hands you one clean alert, we hand you a pile of noise." That
      admission is what makes Act 3 believable.
      Un-rigging measures, all mandatory: third-party rules only; camouflage strategies
      pre-registered in git before the demo; **the examiner picks** attack and level
      from the grid rather than watching a scripted sequence; and include conditions
      where we lose — a demo that never loses reads as rigged even when it isn't.
- [ ] **Stage 3 — Detection depth.**
      **Drain3** online template mining replacing hand-written regex (makes the system
      source-agnostic; it is also what the log-anomaly literature uses).
      **Sequence modelling** — the highest-value single change available. v1 scores each
      line independently, but attacks are sequences; a single odd line is weak evidence
      and an odd *sequence* is strong evidence. This is the root cause of the 0.29
      precision. Even a Markov transition model over template IDs per user would help.
      Also: peer-group baselines (fixes cold start), score calibration so severity tiers
      mean something numeric, drift handling.
- [ ] **Stage 4 — Correlation & MITRE.** Replace union-find grouping with an **entity
      graph** (users/IPs/hosts/processes as nodes, events as edges, incidents as
      temporally-decayed connected subgraphs) — this is what makes multi-source
      correlation possible. Ingest the official **ATT&CK STIX bundle** instead of the
      hand-written table; add tactic and kill-chain mapping; produce a **detection
      coverage matrix** (which techniques can this system even see?).
- [ ] **Stage 5 — LLM layer maturity.** Structured JSON output instead of free prose;
      model routing (small/fast for triage lines, larger for full narratives); retrieval
      over ATT&CK text; and **automated faithfulness evaluation** — does every claim in a
      narrative trace to a logged event? The anti-hallucination architecture is currently
      asserted and untested.
- [ ] **Stage 6 — Adversarial platform.** ⭐ *The differentiator.* More strategies; an
      **adaptive adversary** that queries the detector and optimises against it (far
      stronger than v1's seven fixed transformations); independent red-teaming by other
      people. Long-term this is the publishable part.
- [ ] **Stage 7 — Multi-source & deployment.** Auth + syslog + web + journald normalised
      onto a common schema (**ECS** is the standard; adopting it buys interop).
      Collector/analyzer split, Docker compose. This is where the project outgrows the
      hardware — it is last for that reason.

### Known issues / TODO carried over from v1

- **Precision 0.29 / 94 incidents for 9 real attacks** is the headline weakness.
  `CONTAMINATION=0.10` was tested as a fix and **rejected on adversarial evidence**
  (`docs/results.v1/contamination_retune.md`) — it degrades `mimicry` 100%→93% and
  `realistic-combo` 91%→87%. Contamination is not the lever. Sequence modelling
  (Stage 3) is the real fix. Untried cheap wins: suppress singleton incidents with no
  MITRE match, recalibrate `SEVERITY_THRESHOLDS`.
- **Scenario B (impossible travel) is detected entirely by the hand-written rule** —
  the embeddings contribute nothing, because both login legs are identical vectors after
  IP masking. Never claim "embedding-based detection catches impossible travel."
- **Impossible-travel incidents show the conclusion without the evidence** — only the
  arriving login is flagged and grouped; the earlier login it was compared against is
  benign and never carried in. Display-layer bug, detection unaffected. Fix when the
  entity graph lands (Stage 4) — it makes carrying the compared-against event natural.
- **The v1 rule baseline is near-oracle by construction** — the corpus is built from the
  same three attack templates the rules encode. Stage 1's third-party rulesets are the
  honest fix.
- `preprocessing.py`'s `__main__` is a required-args CLI, so it has no no-arg smoke test.
  Moot once pytest lands in Stage 0.
- v1's severity tiers do not cleanly separate precision by tier (medium is noisier than
  low). Informal calls against a 45-line ground truth, never calibrated. Stage 3.

## 3b. Dataset Strategy

**Note:** HDFS and BGL *are* LogHub datasets — LogHub is the collection containing HDFS,
BGL, Thunderbird, OpenSSH, Linux, Hadoop and others. The choice is *which corpus*, and
it splits along a line that matters enormously here.

| Corpus | Size (verify before use) | Labels | Contains attacks? | Use here |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **OpenSSH** | ~655k lines | none | **Yes** — real brute force / enumeration from the open internet | ⭐ **primary** |
| **Linux** | ~25k lines | none | some real auth events | companion |
| **BGL** | ~4.7M lines | per **line** | no — hardware/kernel faults | optional, secondary |
| **HDFS** | ~11M lines | per **block** | no — disk/replication faults | **skip** |
| v1 synthetic | 751 lines | full ground truth | yes, authored | keep as regression corpus |

### Why not HDFS or BGL as primary

They are labelled, which is why the literature uses them. But their "anomalies" are
**system faults, not adversarial behaviour** — no attacker chose to be there. Three
consequences, all fatal to this project's actual contributions:

- **MITRE mapping has nothing to map.** There is no technique ID for a failed block replication.
- **Attack narrative has no attacker.** Novelty pillar #1 goes dark.
- **Camouflage is meaningless.** You cannot hide a disk failure — there is no adversary
  making choices. The north star (§1) goes dark too.

Running on HDFS/BGL would benchmark the *anomaly detection layer* — the layer this
project explicitly does not claim as its contribution — while switching off both things
that make it distinctive.

If literature comparability is later wanted, prefer **BGL over HDFS**: its per-line
labels drop straight into the existing line-level P/R/F1 harness, whereas HDFS's
block-level labels force restructuring the entire evaluation to block granularity for
no gain to any claim this project makes.

### Evaluating OpenSSH without labels

OpenSSH has no ground truth and 655k lines cannot be hand-labelled. Two complementary
methods, neither requiring full labelling:

1. **Precision@k with manual verification** — run the pipeline, take the top 20-50
   ranked incidents, verify each by hand, report what fraction are genuine. A legitimate
   and commonly used method for unlabelled corpora, costs an afternoon, and *"it found
   real attacks in real logs nobody labelled for it"* is a stronger claim than any F1 on
   authored data.
2. **Inject v1's attack scenarios into the real benign traffic** — gives exact ground
   truth for the injected instances against a realistic background, which is what the
   §1b kill-point experiment needs.

### Note for Stage 3

Sequence modelling **cannot be trained on the 751-line synthetic corpus** — it is far
too thin. It depends on real data landing first, which is another reason Stage 1
precedes Stage 3.

---

## 4. Benchmark Discipline (the rule that makes this project mean anything)

**No change to detection, grouping, or scoring lands without re-running the evaluation
suite and recording the delta.** Not "it looks better." Numbers.

Every such change must report, at minimum:

1. Line-level P/R/F1 vs `docs/results.v1/`
2. Instance detection on the clean corpus
3. **Instance detection under camouflage** — pooled over ≥5 seeds
4. Alert volume (incident count)

Item 3 is not optional and it is the one people skip. The single hardest-won lesson
from v1:

> **Any tuning validated only on clean data must be re-validated under camouflage.
> Clean instance detection saturates at 100% and hides exactly the safety margin that
> camouflage eats first.**

This was learned the expensive way — see the 2026-08-16 contamination entry in
`docs/CLAUDE.v1.md`. A change that improves clean precision and quietly costs 7 points
of mimicry robustness is a **bad change**, and without item 3 you cannot see it.

Single-seed results are also not admissible for instance detection: with 3 instances per
scenario a single seed moves the number in 33% steps. v1 observed `ip_rotate` reading
100% at one seed and 84% pooled over five.

---

## 5. Target Architecture

Where this is going. Not all of it exists yet — build toward it stage by stage.

```
  ingestion            journald · file tail · replay · (later: web/syslog/multi-host)
      ↓                normalise → ECS-style common event schema
  parsing              Drain3 online template mining  (replaces v1 hand regex)
      ↓
  storage              SQLite/DuckDB: events, templates, entities, incidents, scores
      ↓
  detection            per-line: embeddings + Isolation Forest   (v1, kept)
                       per-sequence: Markov/DeepLog over template IDs   (Stage 3)

  evaluation/          ⭐ runs against ALL of the above, every commit
    benchmark harness  · synthetic corpus (v1) · LogHub OpenSSH/Linux
    baselines          · Wazuh manager · Sigma rules · v1 self-written rules
    adversarial        · fixed strategies (v1) · adaptive adversary (Stage 6)
```

**Architectural rule inherited from v1 and still binding:** the evaluation track must
never be imported by the pipeline, and baseline rule implementations must never leak
into detection. Measuring yourself with code you also depend on is how benchmarks lie.

---

## 6. Coding Conventions

Changed from v1 where noted.

- Python 3.11+. Type hints on function signatures.
- **CHANGED: real tests.** `pytest` under `tests/`, not v1's `if __name__ == "__main__"`
  smoke-test convention. That convention existed because v1 had no time for a test
  suite; this repo does. Keep modules runnable standalone where it is genuinely useful
  for debugging, but correctness is asserted in `tests/`.
- Docstring at the top of every module explaining its role in the pipeline.
- Config in `src/<pkg>/config.py`, never magic numbers scattered through modules.
- New dependencies go in `pyproject.toml` via `uv add` **and** get a Decision Log entry.
- Keep functions small enough to paste into a chat for debugging.
- Prefer readable over clever.
- **Never overwrite `docs/results.v1/`.** New results go to `results/`.

## 8. Anti-Goals — push back before proceeding

Revised for the fork. Several v1 anti-goals are gone (see section 2b); these remain,
plus new ones that only become risks now that the timeline pressure is off.

- ❌ **Moving, softening, or reinterpreting the §1b kill point after seeing results.**
  The most important rule in this file.
- ❌ **Scripting the demo narrative before the measurement exists** — it creates
  pressure to tune until reality agrees with the script.
- ❌ **Fine-tuning the narrative LLM.** QLoRA on a 3-8B model is technically possible
  on the 4060, which is exactly why this needs to stay an explicit anti-goal rather
  than a hardware limitation. It does not fix the detection problem, and it makes
  results much harder to reproduce.
- ❌ **Clustering the two laptops for compute** — every model fits on one 8GB GPU;
  splitting across a gigabit link makes inference slower and adds a demo-day failure
  class. Split by *role* (§2c), never by compute.
- ❌ **Making the GPU or the two-machine link required** — CPU single-box is the floor
  and must always work.
- ❌ **Auto-response / blocking (SOAR)** — deliberate product stance. Recommend, never act.
- ❌ **Letting the LLM choose MITRE technique IDs** — the whole grounding design.
- ❌ **Hand-writing detection rules for attacks you also authored** — this is the subtle
  one, and v1's biggest methodological trap. Rules are fine, but they must come from a
  third party (Sigma, Wazuh) or be genuine physics/impossibility checks. The moment you
  write a rule for your own synthetic attack, your evaluation stops meaning anything.
- ❌ **Changing detection without re-running the adversarial suite** — see section 4.
- ❌ **Overwriting or "updating" the v1 results** — they are the historical baseline.
- ❌ **Chasing a 0% adversarial gap** — an honest measured gap beats a suspicious zero.
- ❌ **Rewriting from scratch** — the v1 detection code is proven and its evaluation
  artifacts are the most valuable thing here. Evolve it.
- ❌ **Building on this machine what this machine cannot run** — check free RAM before
  adding a stack. ~5GB free, and Ollama alone wants a large share of it.
- ❌ **Assuming any of the above is a moral judgement about v1.** v1 was scoped for a
  2-3 week solo deadline and made the right calls for that. This is a different repo
  with different constraints.

## 9. Environment & Commands

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"   # uv is not on PATH in fresh shells
uv sync
```

v1 commands still work until Stage 0 restructures the package:

```bash
uv run python src/preprocessing.py --input data/raw/synthetic.log --output data/processed/parsed.csv --year 2026
uv run python src/pipeline.py --input data/processed/parsed.csv --no-llm
uv run python src/adversarial.py                # robustness eval, 5 seeds, ~8 min
uv run python src/adversarial.py --seeds 1      # quick pass while iterating
uv run python src/evaluate.py                   # baseline comparison, ~5 min
uv run streamlit run src/dashboard.py
```

Ollama (separate terminal, required for narrative steps):
```bash
ollama serve
ollama pull phi3
```

**Note:** `data/processed/` IS gitignored in this repo (it is regenerable output).
The frozen demo folder deliberately commits it instead — do not copy that choice here.

## 10. Decision Log

> **Agent: append here whenever a technical decision is made. Never delete entries.**
> **Inherited entries live in `docs/CLAUDE.v1.md` section 10 and remain authoritative
> for anything predating the fork.**

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-17 | Forked rather than continuing in `Project`; v1 frozen at tag `v1.0-submission` | The submitted artifact must keep reproducing the numbers in the report. Development that is free to break detection cannot share a repo with that. A third folder (`log-anomaly-detector-demo`) carries the runnable demo with `data/processed/` committed, so the demo survives a clone |
| 2026-08-17 | Fork by copy-and-evolve, not clean rewrite | The detection code is proven and the evaluation artifacts are the most valuable asset in the project — they are the baseline every future change is measured against. A rewrite discards exactly the part that gives the work credibility |
| 2026-08-17 | Benchmark platform (Stage 1) is sequenced **before** any detection change (Stage 3+) | Without automated measurement you cannot tell whether a change helped, and detection work "feels" better far more often than it measures better. Front-loading it also delivers the third-party SIEM baselines early, which is the fastest available credibility win |
| 2026-08-17 | Third-party rulesets (Wazuh manager / Sigma) replace the self-written rule baseline as the primary comparison | v1's baseline scored F1 0.96 partly because the same author wrote the attacks and the rules that catch them — near-oracle by construction, and the write-up had to concede it. Rules authored by people who have never seen this corpus remove that objection entirely |
| 2026-08-17 | Wazuh is to be run as **manager/analysis-engine only**, offline, with alerts exported for comparison — not as the full indexer+dashboard stack, and not live during a demo | The full stack wants ~6GB; this machine has ~5GB free with Ollama also needing a large share. Comparing exported alerts inside our own dashboard is both memory-safe and a better demo than alt-tabbing between two web UIs |
| 2026-08-17 | Sequence modelling identified as the highest-value detection change, ahead of any embedding or threshold work | v1 scores every line independently, which is the structural cause of precision 0.29 — one unusual line is inherently weak evidence. The contamination sweep already proved thresholds cannot fix this without costing robustness. Modelling *order* changes what evidence is available rather than re-weighting the same evidence |
| 2026-08-17 | "Real-time" is defined as file-tail + micro-batch scoring against pre-fitted models, and LLM narration stays **on-demand** | Honest scoping. Tailing with micro-batches is genuinely how many detection deployments work, and splitting fit-from-score ("fit on history, score on stream") is better engineering than v1's single-pass fit-and-score. But phi3 at 40-60s/incident on CPU is a floor, not a tuning problem — claiming real-time narration would be a lie the demo itself would expose |
| 2026-08-17 | **A kill point was pre-registered (§1b) before any Stage 1 code was written**: ≥25pt robustness differential against a third-party ruleset → continue; 10-25pt → cheap stages only; <10pt → stop and publish the negative result. 4-week deadline, batch mode, one machine | The entire roadmap rests on one unverified assumption — that v1's gap survives rules the author did not write. v1's 0.94→0.07 collapse was against *self-written frequency-threshold* rules that `slow` defeats by construction; a mature third-party ruleset degrades by a different mechanism and those numbers do not transfer. The failure mode for a project like this is not the tech failing, it is spending months building infrastructure around an assumption nobody checked in month one. Registering the criterion in advance is what makes it binding — after seeing results, any threshold becomes negotiable |
| 2026-08-17 | **OpenSSH (+ Linux) chosen as the real-data corpus; HDFS rejected and BGL demoted to optional** | HDFS and BGL are labelled, which is why the literature uses them, but their anomalies are *system faults, not adversarial behaviour*. With no attacker there is nothing for MITRE to map, no narrative to tell, and camouflage is semantically undefined — so both novelty pillars go dark, and what remains is a benchmark of the one layer this project does not claim as its contribution. OpenSSH has real internet brute-force and enumeration in the same log format the preprocessing already handles. Its lack of labels is solved with precision@k plus manual verification, not by switching corpus. BGL over HDFS if comparability is later wanted: per-line labels fit the existing harness, block-level labels would force restructuring the whole evaluation |
| 2026-08-17 | Two laptops split by **role** (monitored host + SIEM / analyzer), explicitly **not clustered for compute**; direct gigabit ethernet, not Thunderbolt or WiFi | Clustering solves "the model does not fit", which is not a problem here — phi3 q4 ≈ 2.3GB and llama3:8b q4 ≈ 4.7GB both fit an 8GB 4060 with headroom, so splitting across a link three orders of magnitude slower than on-card memory makes inference *slower* while adding distributed-training complexity and demo-day failure modes. Role-splitting instead resolves the RAM squeeze, is the Stage 7 collector/analyzer split pulled forward, and is visibly harder to dismiss than two panes of one app. Thunderbolt is not merely unnecessary but *impossible* — machine A has no TB/USB4 controller (verified: Alder Lake PCH, plain USB 3.2 xHCI, no JHL chip) and no ethernet port at all. Bandwidth was never the constraint: 10k lines/sec ≈ 2 MB/s ≈ 1.6% of gigabit. Campus WiFi is excluded because AP client isolation commonly blocks peer-to-peer traffic and is undebuggable in a demo room |
| 2026-08-17 | GPU is an **accelerator, never a requirement**; CPU single-box remains the supported floor and machine A is kept as the CPU benchmark target | "Runs on a laptop with no GPU" is a genuine differentiator — it is the reason a team with no SOC budget could deploy this. Requiring a GPU turns the project into one more ML security tool with infrastructure demands. Keeping both machines as benchmark targets also turns "runs on CPU, much faster on GPU" from a claim into a measured result on two real machines |
| 2026-08-17 | Bake-off Act 2 is framed as **"we both detect it, but we bury you in noise"**, not "we fail to detect it" | The user's original framing had the system failing on the obvious attack. It does not — v1 detects 100% of instances on clean data; what it fails at is precision (94 incidents for 9 attacks). The accurate admission is also the more useful one: it names the real weakness, and conceding a loss before showing a win is what makes the win credible rather than staged |
